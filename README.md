# Air quality sensor kit
This repo contains documentation, source files and code for the following air quality sensor kits:

- Bora kit
- Bora Lora kit
- rIoT

### Bora kit
Air Quality Sensor for the Amsterdam Smart Citizens Lab, measures NO2, dust, temperature and humidity. Developed for a pilot in 2016 to measure air quality around the Valkenburgerstraat and Weesperstraat, under the name [Urban AirQ](http://waag.org/en/project/urban-airq). Citizens actively participated in the measuring process.


### Bora lora kit
The Bora kit was further developed during the [Smart Kids Lab](https://waag.org/en/blog/smart-citizen-kit-measuring-children-school) pilot to improve some criticalities with [LoraWAN](https://www.lora-alliance.org/What-IsLoRa/Technology):
- unstable and weak connectivity of the wifi module
- high power consumption,
- lack of real time data visualization.

### rIot
